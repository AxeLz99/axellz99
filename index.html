	<!--<p align="left"> <u>Realizations after 10 years of gaming.</u> </p>
	
	<hl> <ol>  <p> <li> After 1000s of hours of grinding and tryharding.. what are the only in-game moments you remember? - Only those spent with friends. (Where are those friends now?) </li> </p>

    <p> <li> Skills, items and achievements - all of that has no value in the end, because its after all, virtual and intangible. Does anyone IRL respect you for it? </li> </p>

    <p> <li> You learn nothing. Playing video games is just repeat one pattern over and over and over. How good can that be for your brain? </li> </p>

    <p> <li> You might not feel anything now, but in 10-20 years from now, you will regret abusing your body. The first thing to go are the eyes, then the neck, wrists/hands, knees, lower back. Whats your posture right now? Whats your posture during most of the day? </li> </p>

    <p> <li> As with most things, the 80/20 rule applies to gaming as well. 80% of the time is spent compulsively gaming / grinding / being angry, and only 20% are the good moments. </li> </p>

    <p> <li> Our brains are used to high daily doses of dopamine, thanks to games. We can gradually reduce that with change of entertainment sources. </li> </p>

    <p> <li> We gamers want to feel euphoria. We think that is how humans normally function - being entertained in every single moment of their day, but that is not true. People can happily live a much slower life. Happiness doesn't mean - feeling good. Happiness is balance. Happiness is being busy. I'd rather feel nothing, live slow, than oscillate between euphoria and dread.

    <p> <li> After suddenly quitting games, you will desire to fill the void with social media, youtube, tv shows and porn. Resist.

    <p> <li> Gamers are conservative. New games and music dont fulfill them as much as the games and music of their youth gaming years.

    <p> <li> As you age, gaming isn't as pleasurable anymore, because of the creeping shadow of guilt and obligation. The shadow, though faint, is always there.

   <p> <li>  All my favorite games are dead, with less than 2.000 players online. What does that tell me?

   <p> <li> Adulthood is not bad. We are growing, so the challenges grow with us. The only difference from childhood is that now, we just play a much bigger game. (a game called life)

    <p> <li> If you are a recovering addict, then the internet is like a minefield. All it takes is accidentally running into a meme, picture, or mention somewhere on the internet or in conversation with your friends, and you run the risk of being sucked back in. It's gradual process. You let yourself think more and more about it, then you visit forums and watch videos. Lastly you download it again. </ol>

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p> Anyways, Ive chipped away at my addiction for years and now (since summer 2016) im close to being completely clean. I relapsed last week, after 6 months of no games. but I'm glad that while im playing - i dont feel it anymore. The key is in becoming wiser, more mature, and more knowledgeable about the world. After learning of a whole new world outside, a dream career, a whole new game - i simply cannot return to games anymore. I cant take a step back, even if i force myself.

<p align="left"> <u> After years of experimentation, this is what helped me: </u> </p>

<ul> <li>Read a biography of a great person, and make him your idol.

<li>Find a future dream career, and find an expert in the field and study him. (For example, Dan Lok is my favorite recently)

<li>Replace your big gaming PC with a small laptop. Same goes for phones. Screen size, game fps and keyboard/mouse comfort affect desire for gaming.

<li>Cut all ties. You need closure, no loose ends, no unfinished stories. Delete your gaming accounts, destroy your email accounts. Leave no chance of return.

<li>Remember that the internet is a minefield. Minimize exposure. Leave forums, groups and websites where you can accidentally run into content that can remind you of games. Reset your youtube watch & search history to prevent recommended videos popping up. That's why its better to stop using the internet for entertainment altogether. And ask your friends IRL to avoid talking about games in your presence.

<li>Read realization 6. and be prepared for it. Dont use social media or watch tv shows. You must only take in what is educational. Does anime teach you anything? Read books and explore music for entertainment, or something creative/non-addicting like that. If you have to watch tv shows, have very high standards.

<li>Install linux and use it as your main OS.

<li>You don't change yourself in order to change your habits. You change your habits to change yourself.

<li>Blacklist porn/social media/game sites in your /etc/hosts file (linux) or C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc (windows). But how to stop yourself from removing the blacklist? Create 2 simple watchdog scripts (python or bash for example). The watchdogs watch the file and protect it, while also watching each other, so you cant end them via task manager. If one watchdog isnt working - make your PC shut down or something. You'll have to figure out the code on your own. Its not hard to learn.

<li>If I was super addicted, then gradually retreating to smaller and smaller games (that I liked less) has helped. </ul>
